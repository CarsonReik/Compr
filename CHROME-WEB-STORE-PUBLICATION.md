By installing, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at https://compr.co/terms
```

### 4. Create Privacy Policy ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

Chrome Web Store requires a privacy policy URL. Create this page on your site:

**File to create:** `app/privacy/page.tsx`

**What to include:**
- What data you collect (user ID, extension status, listing data)
- How you use the data (crosslisting automation, analytics)
- What you DON'T collect (browsing history, passwords, personal data)
- How users can delete their data
- GDPR compliance information
- Contact email for privacy concerns

See template below.

### 5. Update Extension for Production

**Remove localhost references:**
```json
// In manifest.json, remove:
"http://localhost:3000/*"
```

Only keep production URLs in `host_permissions` and `externally_connectable`.

**Update constants:**
Check `compr-extension/lib/constants.ts` - ensure API_BASE_URL points to production.

cd build
zip -r ../compr-extension-v1.0.0.zip .
cd ..
```

Or manually:
1. Open the `build/` folder
2. Select all files inside (don't include the build folder itself!)
3. Right-click ‚Üí Compress ‚Üí Create ZIP

**Important:** The manifest.json should be at the ROOT of the ZIP, not in a subfolder.

### Step 3: Create Chrome Web Store Developer Account

1. Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/

1. Click "Submit for Review"

## Common Review Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Permissions Too Broad
**Problem:** "Your extension requests too many permissions"
**Solution:** Only request necessary permissions. We use:
- `tabs` - Required for opening Poshmark tabs
- `storage` - Required for storing user auth
- `alarms` - Required for periodic checks
- `notifications` - For sale alerts
- `webRequest` - For monitoring tab status

All are justified. Document why in review notes.

### Issue 2: Host Permissions
**Problem:** "Why do you need access to these sites?"
**Solution:** Add this to review notes:
```
Host permissions are required for:
- poshmark.com: Automated listing creation
- mercari.com: Automated listing creation
- depop.com: Automated listing creation
- compr.co: Communication with our backend API

The extension only interacts with these specific sites for its core functionality.
```

### Issue 3: Privacy Policy
**Problem:** "Privacy policy is incomplete or missing"
**Solution:** Ensure your privacy policy at `/privacy` covers:
- What data is collected
- How it's used
- How users can delete data
- Third-party services used
- GDPR/CCPA compliance

### Issue 4: Single Purpose
**Problem:** "Extension does too many things"
**Solution:** Emphasize single purpose in description:
```
Single Purpose: Automate crosslisting to resale marketplaces
All features support this core purpose:
- Form filling: Enters listing data
- Image upload: Adds product photos
- Browser automation: Submits listings
```

### Update Your Website

2. Update connections page with actual Chrome Web Store link

3. Create new ZIP file
4. Upload to Chrome Web Store Developer Console
5. Submit for review (faster than initial review, usually 1-2 days)
